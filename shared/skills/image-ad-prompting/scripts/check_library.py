"""Executable evals for the shared image-ad prompt library. No network, no credits.

Runs the mechanical half of evals.md against
`prompting/prompt-library.md` and the skills that consume it:

  L1  every template + the always-on suffixes fits the prompt cap of the model it
      is sent under, which since spec 2.16.0 is a different number per model
  L1b the library publishes how many templates still have room for the pin block
  L2  no template states two different counts for the same countable element
  L3  a template whose art must be numerically true carries the approximation note
  L4  every skill whose output has spoken audio carries the transcribe-verify step
  L5  every template has the fields the format requires, with a real aspect ratio
  L6  every doc that states a library template count states the real one

The three always-on safety suffixes are IMPORTED from the generator script rather
than restated here, so this file cannot drift from the script it is checking. If
someone edits a suffix, L1's arithmetic moves with it.

L1 carries a dated BASELINE of templates that exceed the TIGHTEST cap on the API,
which is reve-2.1's. They are grandfathered, not forgiven: the list may only
shrink, and it is exact in both directions. A template that is not on it must fit
reve-2.1, and a template on it that starts fitting fails until it is removed,
which is how a ratchet stays a ratchet instead of becoming a suppression list.
Nothing here edits a prompt to buy a green check; every body in this library is a
validated artifact, and trimming one costs a re-validation render to prove the
render did not change.
