"""Does this source actually contain SPEECH? Free, local, and it runs before you spend.

    python3 check-speech.py <file> [--json]

Exit codes, which are the whole point of the script:

    0  speech        one talking voice is present. Safe to price and convert.
    2  no speech     no audio stream, silence, or audio that is not a talking
                     voice (a music bed, a room tone, an effects-only track).
                     REFUSE. Do not call the endpoint.
    3  unclear       the measurements disagree. Stop and have a human listen
                     before anything is charged.
    1  could not run ffmpeg/ffprobe missing, or the file could not be read.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `POST /v1/voice-changes` gates on "does this have an audio
track", not on "is anyone talking". Send it a music bed and it converts the music
into vocal noise, bills the full per-minute rate, and returns `200`. That is a
charged success, not an error, and no retry gets the credits back. This check is
free and takes about a second, so it runs first, every time.

HOW IT DECIDES. Two independent measurements, from voiceprint.measure():

  voicedFraction  the share of loud frames that are periodic in the human
                  speaking range (70-350 Hz). A talking voice is periodic almost
                  everywhere it is loud. A mix of instruments is not: the
                  autocorrelation peak jumps between notes and harmonics and
                  fails on a large minority of frames.
  f0Iqr           the interquartile spread of the detected pitch, in Hz. ONE
                  person's voice lives in a narrow band. Music does not.

Measured on 13 real files before the thresholds were chosen (2026-08-12). The
same set is tabulated in evals.md § C:

  a 15s UGC ad (speech + a glass-shatter effect)   voiced 0.93   iqr  27
  its speech span alone, from 2.2s                 voiced 0.96   iqr  26
  a re-voiced cut of the same ad                   voiced 0.91   iqr  18
  three synthesized voice-over takes, es and en    voiced 0.97-1.00  iqr 49-56
  a 5s UGC voice track                             voiced 0.99   iqr  33
  an 85s phone recording of one speaker            voiced 0.98   iqr  19
  the same ad's first 2.1s: effect, no speech      voiced 0.18   iqr  35
  an instrumental hip-hop track (full, and a 30s cut)  voiced 0.77-0.78  iqr 158-222
  an instrumental film cue (full, and a 30s cut)   voiced 0.48-0.49  iqr  58-212

So on that set every speech file sits at 0.91 or above and every non-speech file
at 0.78 or below. SPEECH_MIN is the midpoint of that gap rather than either edge,
and NOSPEECH_MAX is set well under it so the band between them is genuinely
"these do not agree, ask a human" and not a rounding error. The pitch-spread
ceiling is the second, independent test: it catches a polyphonic bed that happens
to score high on periodicity.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, stated because a gate that oversells itself is worse than none:

* SUNG vocals read as speech. One singer is one periodic voice in the same range.
  A song sent to the endpoint converts and charges like any other source.
* Narration OVER a music bed reads as speech, correctly -- but the endpoint
  converts the WHOLE track, bed included. Fence the bed in assembly, or convert a
  music-free cut of the audio.
* It measures a whole file. A source that is 30s of music followed by 4s of
  speech is a source with speech in it; use --json, read speechStart, and cut.
