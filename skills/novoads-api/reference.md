# Novoads REST API reference

Companion to `SKILL.md`. Read that first for the call sequence. This file is the field-level detail and the lab notebook.

**The authority is <https://api.novoads.ai/v1/openapi.json>.** Where this file and the spec disagree, the spec wins, except in *Known discrepancies* below, where the spec is wrong and this file says so.

## Base URL and auth

```
https://api.novoads.ai/v1
Authorization: Bearer novo_<64 hex>
```

The key is shown once, at creation, and cannot be retrieved afterward. Create and revoke at <https://novoads.ai/dashboard/settings?tab=api>. Maximum 10 live keys per organization.

API generations draw from the organization's plan credits at the same rate as the dashboard. There is no separate API wallet, no free API tier, and no separate API plan: any live subscription, the $1 trial included, can generate here.

### Use `curl`. A `403` with `error code: 1010` is Cloudflare, not your key

**The API sits behind Cloudflare, and Cloudflare's bot rule refuses `python3-urllib` outright.** A request sent with Python's stdlib `urllib` default `User-Agent` comes back `403` carrying a bare edge page with **`error code: 1010`** — not a Novoads `{"error":{...}}` envelope, no `code`, no `requestId`. The same key, on the same endpoint, over `curl`, succeeds a second later.

It reads exactly like a revoked key or a dead subscription and is **neither**. Two tells:

- **The body is the wrong shape.** Every real Novoads failure is the `{"error":{"code",...,"requestId"}}` envelope in *Errors* below. An HTML-ish page with a numeric Cloudflare code never came from this API's application layer.
- **It hits everything at once.** On 2026-08-02 it took all three estimate calls simultaneously while a `GET /v1/products` issued moments earlier over `curl` had already succeeded. A genuine auth or plan failure would have refused that one too.

**The fix is the client, not the credential.** Use `curl`, as every example in this repo does. If you must call from Python, send a browser-like `User-Agent` — the default is the whole problem. Do not "fix" this by regenerating a key, checking the subscription, or telling the user their plan lapsed.

Ad analysis (reading an existing ad into a structured hook, beats, casting and layout breakdown) is **not** on this API. It lives on the [MCP connector](https://novoads.ai/mcp) as `analyze_ad`. That is deliberate, not a gap to route around.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/uploads` | Mint a presigned PUT for a reference image or video. |
| `POST` | `/estimates` | Price a generation. Spends nothing. The only source of a credit number. |
| `POST` | `/videos` | Submit a video. `202`, charged, asynchronous. |
| `POST` | `/images` | Generate images. Synchronous, images in the response. |
| `POST` | `/music` | Generate a music bed from a prompt. `202`, charged, asynchronous. Returns **two** tracks. |
| `POST` | `/captions` | Burn subtitles into a generated or uploaded video. `202`, charged, asynchronous. |
| `POST` | `/transcripts` | The words of a video with their timings. **`200`, charged, SYNCHRONOUS — the transcript is in the response.** |
| `POST` | `/videos/{jobId}/captions` | Same operation, source in the path. Generated videos only. |
| `GET` | `/caption-presets` | The 30 caption styles, with tier and per-minute rate. |
| `GET` | `/generations` | List jobs, filterable and paginated. |
| `GET` | `/generations/{jobId}` | One job, with `outputUrl` once it has succeeded. |
| `GET` | `/generations/{jobId}/watch` | `302` to a freshly signed download URL. |
| `GET` | `/models` | The model catalog, with each model's grid and price. |
| `GET` `POST` | `/products` | List and create products. |
| `GET` `PATCH` `DELETE` | `/products/{productId}` | One product. |
| `GET` | `/products/{productId}/folders` | Folders under a product. Read-only. |

`GET /v1/openapi.json` is public and needs no key. There are **no** folder-creation, project, or add-to-project endpoints on v1.

## POST /uploads

Request:

```json
{ "contentType": "image/jpeg", "sizeBytes": 248193 }
```

`contentType` is one of `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `video/mp4`, `video/quicktime`, `video/webm`. `sizeBytes` is the exact byte count, maximum 104,857,600 (100 MB).

Response `201`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `assetId` | Use in `startImageAssetId` and `referenceAssetIds`. Scoped to your organization. |
| `uploadUrl` | Presigned. PUT the raw bytes here. |
| `method` | The verb the URL was signed for. |
| `headers` | Send these on the PUT, byte for byte. |
| `expiresInSeconds` | 900. Request a new URL rather than retrying an expired PUT. |
| `maxBytes` | Ceiling this endpoint accepts. |

**`Content-Type` and `Content-Length` are both signed into the URL.** If either differs from what was returned, storage rejects the PUT with a 403 that looks like an auth failure and is not one. `image/jpeg; charset=utf-8` is the classic way to lose an hour here. Measure the file, do not estimate it.

**The `assetId` is durable and reusable, without limit.** It is the storage key itself, resolution is a stateless check plus a fresh presign on every call, and nothing consumes it: the same id works on call one and call one hundred, from `startImageAssetId`, from `referenceAssetIds`, and from the MCP tool. Upload the product photo once and reuse it across every iteration and every model. The **900 second expiry belongs to the upload URL, not to the asset** — that is the distinction most likely to be conflated.

## POST /estimates

Discriminated on `kind`, and strict. Any field not listed is a 400.

**There are more than two arms.** `kind: "caption"` prices `POST /captions` and `kind: "transcript"` prices `POST /transcripts` — see those sections for their fields and for the reason a sourceless quote is the one-minute minimum on both. Which arms a deployment publishes is flag-dependent (`music`, `transcript` and `voiceover` each have their own); read the live `openapi.json` `discriminator.mapping` rather than counting them here.

| Field | `kind: "video"` | `kind: "image"` |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | required, `"video"` | required, `"image"` |
| `prompt` | required | required |
| `model` | `seedance-2.0` (default), `seedance-2.0-mini`, `omni-flash`, `veo-3.1`, `sora-2` | `gpt-image-2` (default), `nano-banana-pro`, `reve-2.1` |
| `durationSeconds` | 4 to 15 | n/a |
| `resolution` | `480p` `720p` `1080p` `4k` — **range-checked per model** | n/a |
| `numImages` | n/a | 1 to 4 |
| `language` | `en` `es` `pt` `fr` `de` `it` `zh` `ja` `ko` `ar` `hi` | same |

All eight models price here, `veo-3.1` and `sora-2` included (verified live, 2026-08-02).

**`resolution` is accepted here because it moves the price** — on `seedance-2.0`, `1080p` is ≈2.5x the `720p` base and `4k` ≈5x (verified live 2026-08-04). Like `durationSeconds`, the enum in the table is the schema's union and **not** what any one model accepts: the service range-checks it against the named model, so `{"model":"seedance-2.0-mini","resolution":"1080p"}` comes back `400 resolution must be one of 720p for seedance-2.0-mini` while `720p` prices cleanly (verified live 2026-08-04). Full per-model table and the mini caveat under *POST /videos → `resolution`*.

There is **no `styleFamily`** on either arm. The field was deleted from the whole API in spec `2.0.0`, and both arms are strict, so a body carrying it comes back `400 (root): Unrecognized key: "styleFamily"` (verified live, 2026-08-02).

There is **no `audioEnabled`** on either arm, and that is deliberate rather than an omission: the field does not move the price, and this endpoint takes only fields that do. Sending it is `400 Unrecognized key: "audioEnabled"` even on `seedance-2.0`, where the *generation* call accepts it (verified live, 2026-08-02). Price the render without it; send it on `POST /videos`.

**`durationSeconds` is validated against the *named model's* grid here, not against the 4–15 span in the table.** Same behavior as the prompt ceiling: `{"model":"sora-2","durationSeconds":11}` comes back `400 durationSeconds must be one of 4, 8, 12 for sora-2.` while `8` prices cleanly (verified live, 2026-08-02). So the free call catches an out-of-grid duration before the paid one does — one more reason to run it every time.

Response:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `credits` | What the generation would cost. |
| `balance` | Organization balance at read time. A snapshot, not a reservation. |
| `sufficient` | `balance >= credits` at that moment. |
| `shortBy` | Present when short. |
| `topUpUrl` | Present when short. |

| `warnings` | Advisory craft advice: `[{ rule, message }]`. Omitted when nothing fires. **This endpoint is the only one that returns it** (verified live 2026-08-04). |

**`warnings` never refuses the call and never changes `credits`** — and it false-positives. See *Prompt rules* below before you act on one.

Pass `model` explicitly. Video schedules differ by 2x across the set, image schedules by more than 3x.

**The schema's 20,000-character `prompt` ceiling is not the one that binds.** The service applies the *named model's* limit here too, so a 5,000-character prompt priced as `seedance-2.0` is rejected at the estimate, for free, exactly as the paid call would reject it. Omit `model` and it is judged as `seedance-2.0`. Only `omni-flash` genuinely accepts 20,000.

This endpoint refuses a churned organization with a 403, on purpose. `sufficient` is a claim that the generation would go through, so answering `true` to an account whose generation would then be refused is a quote that disagrees with the invoice.

**Two things the estimate cannot see.** It never receives `aspectRatio`, `startImageAssetId`, `referenceAssetIds` or `productId`, because none of them moves the price. And it **skips moderation**, deliberately — running it would pay for a moderation call on every estimate for a verdict that almost never differs. So the one gap left is a prompt that prices clean here and fails moderation: `422` at generation. Nothing is charged in that case either.

**What this endpoint does with the prompt, exactly.** The price does not depend on it at all — that comes from the model and the duration, resolution or image count. The prompt is checked for two things: the named model's character ceiling, which is a hard `400`; and the craft rules, which are **advisory** and come back in `warnings` without affecting the price or the outcome. See *Prompt rules* below — they false-positive, so they are read and judged, not applied.

---

## POST /videos

Per-model request bodies, all `.strict()`.

**Shared by all five video models:** `model`, `prompt`, `durationSeconds`, `aspectRatio`, `language`, `startImageAssetId`, `productId`. Only `model` and `prompt` are required. Beyond that the variants differ, and every difference is a `400` rather than a dropped field:

- **`referenceAssetIds`** — the two Seedance variants only. `omni-flash`, `veo-3.1` and `sora-2` have no such field.
- **`audioEnabled`** — the two Seedance variants only. See below.

There is **no `styleFamily`** on any variant. It was deleted from the API in spec `2.0.0` along with the blocking prompt rules it scoped, and the variants are strict, so sending it is a `400`.

| `model` | `durationSeconds` (default) | `aspectRatio` | `refs` | `audio` | Prompt max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `seedance-2.0` | 4–15, any integer (**5**) | `16:9` (default) `9:16` `1:1` `4:3` `3:4` `21:9` | ≤9 | yes | 4,000 |
| `seedance-2.0-mini` | same (**10**) | same | ≤9 | yes | 4,000 |
| `omni-flash` | 4, 6, 8, 10 (**8**) | `9:16` (default) `16:9` | — | — | 20,000 |
| `veo-3.1` | 4, 6, 8 (**8**) | `9:16` (default) `16:9` | — | — | 4,000 |
| `sora-2` | 4, 8, 12 (**4**) | `9:16` (default) `16:9` | — | — | 4,000 |

Defaults that bite: **Seedance defaults to `16:9`**, alone among the five — every other model already defaults to `9:16`. On duration, `seedance-2.0` defaults to 5 and mini to 10, `omni-flash` to 8, `sora-2` to 4, and **`veo-3.1` to 8, which is also its maximum** — the only model here that defaults to its ceiling. An out-of-grid `durationSeconds` is rejected, never rounded. Set both fields explicitly on any ad.

### `audioEnabled`

A boolean on **`seedance-2.0` and `seedance-2.0-mini` only**, default `true` — omit it and the endpoint renders exactly what it rendered before the field existed. It controls the synchronized sound effects, ambient sound and lip-synced speech the model generates from the prompt.

Send `false` for a clip that is meant to be silent: a pipeline laying its own voice-over in post otherwise pays for a voice track it throws away, and a product cutaway built to run muted comes back with sound effects nobody hears.

**It does not change the price**, the length, or anything else about the grid — both Seedance providers charge the same either way, which is why `POST /estimates` refuses the field.

Verified live 2026-08-02, each probe pinned with an out-of-grid `durationSeconds` so no body could be valid and none could charge:

| Sent to | Result |
|---|---|
| `seedance-2.0`, `seedance-2.0-mini` | accepted — the only complaint was the pinned duration |
| `omni-flash`, `veo-3.1`, `sora-2` | `400 Unrecognized key: "audioEnabled"` |
| `POST /estimates`, any model | `400 Unrecognized key: "audioEnabled"` |

**Keep the prose silence clause in the prompt as well.** The flag mutes the render; the clause (`a silent product film with no spoken dialogue`) stops the model staging a talking shot in the first place — an actor mouthing nothing, billed in full. They do different jobs and the belt-and-suspenders pair is deliberate.

Response `202`: `jobId`, `status`, `creditsCharged`, `model`. **No `warnings`** — this endpoint does not run the prompt rules. They run on `POST /estimates` only (see *Prompt rules*), so the advice was already on the quote you took before submitting.

`creditsCharged` is in the unit the billing page shows. Internally 1 credit is 10 centi-credits; the API has already converted, so echo the number as given.

### `startImageAssetId` and `referenceAssetIds` are two modes, not two fields

Confirmed against the deployed spec `2.0.0` on 2026-08-02 (the `1.2.0`-era note that video took no references is superseded).

| | `startImageAssetId` | `referenceAssetIds` |
|---|---|---|
| What the model does with it | Animates the image as the **first frame** | **Composites** the images as visual references — a character, a product, a wardrobe, a setting |
| How many | 1 | Up to **9** |
| Which models | all five | `seedance-2.0` and `seedance-2.0-mini` only — the `omni-flash`, `veo-3.1` and `sora-2` variants omit the field, and all three are strict (`400 Unrecognized key`, verified live 2026-08-02) |
| Addressed in the prompt | no | yes: `@Image1`, `@Image2` … in the order you send them |

**Sending both is a 400**, not a merge: they select different modes on the provider.

**Images only** — `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`. `POST /uploads` also accepts video, and a video `assetId` here is an error rather than a reference: the providers price video-input renders differently while the credit cost here is a function of duration alone, so accepting one would make the quote disagree with the invoice.

An `@ImageN` token pointing past the end of the array is refused **before the charge** — an unresolvable reference is a content failure at the provider, and a 400 is a better answer than a refunded render.

### `resolution` — on `seedance-2.0` only, and it is a price field

Verified live 2026-08-04 against deployed spec **2.6.0**. The earlier note here — that no variant had the field and `GET /models` published no output size — described an older deployment and is superseded.

| `model` | `resolution` accepted | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `seedance-2.0` | `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`, `4k` | `720p` |
| `seedance-2.0-mini` | **none — the variant has no such property** | 720p, fixed |
| `omni-flash`, `sora-2` | **none** | 720p, fixed |
| `veo-3.1` | **none** | 1080p, fixed |

**`GET /v1/models` now publishes this**: each entry carries `resolutions[]` and `defaultResolution`. That is the authority — read it rather than trusting this table, which is a snapshot.

**It changes the price**, which makes it unlike every other output-shape field here. Relative to the `720p` base on `seedance-2.0`: `480p` is **the same**, `1080p` is **≈2.5x**, `4k` is **≈5x**. Those ratios are for warning a user before they ask for 4k — **the number they approve still comes from `POST /estimates`**, and this repo holds no rate table (see SKILL.md gate 2).

**`POST /estimates` takes `resolution`** on the video arm and prices it, so the quote can track the tier you actually intend to render.

**The `seedance-2.0-mini` split-brain, verified live 2026-08-04.** The estimate arm's `resolution` enum is shared across all five models, but the server range-checks it per model:

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `POST /estimates`, mini, `resolution: "720p"` | `200` — priced, identical to omitting the field |
| `POST /estimates`, mini, `480p` / `1080p` / `4k` | `400 invalid_input` — *"resolution must be one of 720p for seedance-2.0-mini"* |
| `POST /videos`, mini, any `resolution` | `400 Unrecognized key: "resolution"` — the variant has no such property (**observed 2026-08-04, not re-verified**: confirming it again means a paid render) |

**So an estimate that accepted `resolution` is not a licence to send it to `POST /videos`.** On mini, never send the key at all.

Output size actually measured, at `9:16`: `seedance-2.0` at its `720p` default and `sora-2` both returned **720x1280** (2026-08-02, ffprobe). `omni-flash` and `veo-3.1` are unmeasured — do not quote a number for them, and do not generalise 720p across the set now that Veo is on it.

There are **no idempotency keys.** See the 500 note below.

---

## POST /images

| `model` | `aspectRatio` | `referenceAssetIds` | `numImages` | Prompt max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-image-2` (default) | `1:1` (default) `4:5` `2:3` `9:16` `16:9` `21:9` | up to **4** | 1 to 4 | 4,000 |
| `nano-banana-pro` | `1:1` `2:3` `3:2` `3:4` `4:3` `4:5` `5:4` `9:16` `16:9` `21:9` | up to **14** | 1 to 4 | 4,000 |
| `reve-2.1` | same as Nano Banana Pro | up to **8** | 1 to 4 | 4,000 |

**The reference cap is per model and is not uniform.** `gpt-image-2` takes 4, `nano-banana-pro` 14, `reve-2.1` 8. Do not carry one number across the set — the bodies are strict, so a fifth reference to `gpt-image-2` is `400 Too big: expected array to have <=4 items` rather than a silently dropped image, which is the good outcome: a dropped reference is a paid render missing the product. Verified live 2026-08-04 against spec 2.7.0 (which raised `nano-banana-pro` from 4 to 14), each probe pinned with an out-of-range `numImages` so no body could be valid: 15 refs on `nano-banana-pro` → too big, 14 → accepted; 9 on `reve-2.1` → too big, 8 → accepted; 5 on `gpt-image-2` → too big. Standing re-check: `./scripts/verify-image-caps.sh`.

Synchronous. The response carries `images[]` (`url`, `expiresInSeconds` 3600, `width`, `height`), `jobId`, `status`, `creditsCharged`, and `model`. **No `warnings`**, for the same reason as video: the prompt rules run on `POST /estimates` only. In practice image prompts are unlinted either way — an image estimate carrying the words that trip the video rules returned no `warnings` key at all (verified live 2026-08-04). Nothing to poll. `numImages` multiplies the price.

Reference order is preserved and can be addressed positionally by the prompt. There is no base64 field: upload first, pass ids.

Images accept **no `startImageAssetId`** — there is no first-frame concept on a still — and **no `styleFamily`**, which no longer exists anywhere on this API.

### The response is the only copy of images 2..N

A `numImages > 1` call charges for every image, but only the **first** is recoverable
afterwards. `GET /generations/{jobId}` returns a single `outputUrl` — image 1 — and images
2..N exist nowhere but the body of the response that returned them. Lose that response and
the credits stay spent.

That is not a hypothetical: the render blocks inside the POST for 60–90 seconds, so a
proxy or CDN idle-timeout on a long call drops a response for work the API already did and
charged for. Two consequences worth building around:

- **Write each image to disk as you read it**, before doing anything else with the response.
  Do not hold a batch in memory and save at the end.
- **Prefer one image per call in a long batch.** `numImages: 4` is one concurrency slot and
  the same price as four calls, which is the right trade when four variants of one prompt
  are wanted. It is the wrong trade when the four are independent deliverables, because it
  puts three unrecoverable images behind a single response.

If a call does time out, do **not** re-send it — there are no idempotency keys, so a retry
renders and charges again. Check `GET /generations` first and match on `createdAt`; a job
that landed is already there, and image 1 is retrievable even though its siblings are not.

## POST /captions, POST /videos/{jobId}/captions

Documented from the live spec `2.6.0` on 2026-08-04. This endpoint family was **missing from this pack entirely** until then; the decision tree routed every caption request to the local ffmpeg skill as though no first-party endpoint existed.

Burns styled subtitles into a video and returns a `jobId`. **Asynchronous and charged**, exactly like `POST /videos`: poll `GET /generations/{jobId}` to a terminal status, then `…/watch`.

| Field | `POST /captions` | `POST /videos/{jobId}/captions` |
|---|---|---|
| `preset` | **required**, one of 30 | **required**, one of 30 |
| `jobId` | in the body — a video this API generated | **in the path** |
| `assetId` | in the body — a video you uploaded | not expressible |

Both bodies are strict (`additionalProperties: false`). **Exactly one of `jobId` and `assetId`** on `POST /captions`; sending both is a `400` rather than a guess, because captioning the wrong one of two sources still bills for it. The path form exists because an `assetId` contains slashes and cannot be a path segment.

**The subtitle text is transcribed from the video's own audio. There is nothing to write, and there is nothing to read back FROM THIS ENDPOINT:** no response and no field on a caption job carries the caption text or its timings. `GET /generations/{jobId}` on a caption job returns `outputUrl` and no transcript. **The output is a new MP4 with the subtitles burned in — there is no SRT on the captions endpoint** (verified 2026-08-04, still true).

**A workflow that needs the WORDS uses `POST /transcripts`, not this.** That endpoint returns text, word-level timings and an SRT in one synchronous call, and it runs on the BASE video — which is where you want it anyway, because b-roll placement is read from the transcript before the captions step. Captioning and transcribing are two operations, priced separately.

Response `202`: `jobId`, `status`, `creditsCharged`, `model`. `model` is always **`veed/subtitles`** — fixed, and deliberately not in `GET /models`, because that endpoint answers what this API can *generate* with and a caption is applied to a video that already exists.

### Presets and pricing

`GET /caption-presets` → `{ "presets": [{ "id", "tier", "credits" }] }`. Verified live 2026-08-04: **30 presets — 21 `basic` at 0.4 credits/billed minute, 9 `dynamic` at 0.8.** The `dynamic` nine are `glass`, `whisper`, `glide`, `glide2`, `fusion`, `terminal`, `handwritten`, `backdrop`, `backdrop2`.

The meter is `rate x whole minutes, rounded up, minimum one`, **doubled again above the 1080p tier, measured on the SHORT edge** — a portrait `1080x1920` is 1080p held sideways and is *not* doubled; a true 4K source is. Duration and resolution are read from the file at request time, not declared. Everything this API generates is ≤15s, so it bills exactly one minute.

**`POST /estimates` has a third arm for this:** `{ "kind": "caption", "preset", jobId | assetId }`. `preset` is required; the source is optional but **name it for anything over a minute**, because a sourceless quote is the one-minute minimum. Verified live 2026-08-04: sourceless `casper` → `credits: 0.4`; sourceless `glass` → `credits: 0.8`. No prompt, so no `warnings`.

### Failure modes

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `400` | Both source fields, a still passed as `assetId`, or a file that cannot be measured. **A source we cannot measure charges nothing** — unpriceable is unbillable. |
| `402` | Not enough credits; `details` carries `required` and `available`. |
| `404` | No such job or asset **for this organization**, or an upload that never completed. A `jobId` from the dashboard answers 404 identically to one that does not exist — a distinguishable response would be a way to probe what else the account holds. |
| `409` | The source job has not succeeded yet, **or it was rendered with `audioEnabled: false`**. No speech to transcribe, and an empty result you were charged for is worse than a refusal. |
| `429` | `details.reason: caption_concurrency_limit` — **10** concurrent caption jobs, counted **separately** from the 5-generation `concurrency_limit`, so a batch of captions can never block the next render. |

**Re-captioning the same video in the same preset is idempotent and free**: the second call returns the *first* job's id and charges nothing, enforced by a database constraint, so two identical requests racing cannot double-charge. **A different preset on the same video is a new job and a new charge** — style iteration is not free.

---

## POST /transcripts

Documented from the live spec `2.8.0` on 2026-08-04. Gated on `TRANSCRIPT_API`; where the flag
is off the path 400s with a message naming what the deployment does render.

The words of a video, with their timings. **Synchronous** — `200`, and the transcript is in the
response body. There is no `jobId` to poll. It is the **second** charged endpoint here that answers with its
result rather than a job to wait on — `POST /images` is the precedent and states the rule — and it
is deliberate: the provider is one round-trip with no job id of its own, so there is nothing to
poll and nothing to strand.

Measured 2026-08-04: a 15-second ad comes back in about a second, a 5-minute source in ~25s, a
10-minute one in ~46s.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jobId` | string, optional | A video this API generated. **Exactly one of `jobId` / `assetId`.** |
| `assetId` | string, optional | A video you uploaded with `POST /uploads`. **Video only** — uploads accept no audio-only types. Exactly one. |
| `languageCode` | string, optional | `en` `es` `pt` `fr` `de` `it` `zh` `ja` `ko` `ar` `hi`. **Omit it.** Auto-detect is the right default; forcing the wrong language does not fail, it returns a confidently wrong transcript. Note the local `caption-video` path has the OPPOSITE default (it forces English), so do not assume parity. |

Body is strict. There is **no granularity knob** — every response carries all three renderings,
because they are three views of one call and cost nothing extra.

Response `200`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `jobId` | Addressable afterwards at `GET /generations/{jobId}`, whose `outputUrl` presigns the same JSON. |
| `status` | Always `"succeeded"` — the transcript is right here. |
| `creditsCharged` | What this call **was billed**. `0` most often means the transcript was already stored (see below); it also covers a rare race where the job's charge had already been reversed. Treat `0` as "not billed", not as "served from cache". |
| `model` | Always `scribe-v2`. |
| `language` | What the transcriber detected, **verbatim, as ISO-639-3** — `"spa"`, `"eng"`. Not the two-letter code. |
| `durationSeconds` | Length of the source. |
| `text` | The whole transcript as one string. |
| `words[]` | `{ text, start, end }` per word. **Real words only** — the vendor's whitespace tokens are filtered out, so `words.length` is a word count. |
| `segments[]` | `{ start, end, text }` per sentence. |
| `srt` | The same transcript as a SubRip file. |

> **ALL TIMINGS ARE SECONDS**, as decimals — `0.42`, not `420`. The local `caption-video` path
> reports the same concept in **milliseconds**. Mixing them up is a 1000x error that still looks
> plausible, and it is the single most likely way to get this wrong.

### Pricing

**1 centi-credit = 0.1 display credits per BILLED MINUTE**, `ceil(seconds / 60)` with a
one-minute floor. A 15-second ad and a 55-second one both cost **0.1 credits**; a 10-minute
source costs **1.0**. There is **no resolution term** — unlike captions — because the
transcriber is billed on duration and never sees the picture.

**`POST /estimates` has its own arm:** `{ "kind": "transcript", jobId | assetId }`. Source is
optional; name it for anything over a minute, because a sourceless quote is the one-minute
minimum. The arm is **strict and narrower than the generate body** — sending `languageCode` to
the estimate is a `400`, because it does not move the price.

**Transcribing the same source twice is free.** The second call returns the stored transcript
with `creditsCharged: 0`. So a client that times out and retries is not billed twice, and two
skills that each want the same words pay once between them. Verified live 2026-08-05: second call
`creditsCharged: 0`, same `jobId`, every field byte-identical, and **one** charge in the ledger
across both.

What counts as "the same source" is finer than the id, deliberately: the cache identity is
(organization, R2 key, **byte length**, model, language, vocabulary). So a different
`languageCode` is a different transcript rather than a cache hit; **re-uploading different bytes
under the same `assetId` normally MISSES** rather than serving the old words for new media; and a
vocabulary upgrade on our side misses once so the next call gets the better transcript.

The byte-length half is a cheap content check, not a checksum: it catches every ordinary
re-upload, but **a replacement of exactly the same size is still a HIT** and returns the previous
file's words for free. If you replace media in place and need it re-read, upload it under a new
`assetId`.

### Failure modes

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `400` | Both source fields or neither; an unknown key; a source **over the 10-minute cap** (named in the message); or the flag being off on this deployment. **Nothing is charged** for any of those — they are all decided before the debit. One 400 is the exception and arrives *after* it: a container whose declared duration disagrees with its real contents is caught during audio extraction, so it is charged and then refunded. |
| `402` | Not enough credits; `details` carries `required` and `available`. |
| `404` | No such job or asset **for this organization**, or an upload that never completed. **Also a video generated outside this API** — a dashboard `jobId` answers 404 identically to one that does not exist, because a distinguishable response would be a way to probe what else the account holds. **Also a CAPTION job's id**: a caption's output is not a transcript source, and the message says so — pass the jobId of the ORIGINAL video. (An `assetId` that names a still rather than a video is a `400`, not a 404 — nothing is missing, it is the wrong kind.) |
| `409` | Several causes, and **whether you are charged depends on which** — the message always says so. *Before the debit, nothing is charged:* the source job has not succeeded, it has no stored file yet, its stored file could not be read just now (retryable), it has **no audio stream at all** (every b-roll clip is this shape), or a transcript of this source is **already in flight** (the message names the job to poll). *After the debit, charged and then refunded:* the track exists but carries **only room tone**, so no speech was detected — the pre-charge check reads streams, and a stream of silence is still a stream — or the audio could not be extracted. |
| `429` | `details.reason: transcript_concurrency_limit` — **10** concurrent transcripts, counted separately from both the 5-generation `concurrency_limit` and the caption ceiling. |
| `502` | The transcriber failed. **Read the message for the money**, which is not always the same sentence: `Credits were refunded.` means the reversal already landed, while `The refund did not go through on this attempt and has been queued; your credits will be returned automatically.` means it has **not** come back yet and a backstop will return it. |

### What it does not do

No diarization, no speaker labels, no translation. The transcript is faithful to what was said,
in the language it was said in.

### One thing it does that you cannot see

Every call is sent a **server-side biasing vocabulary** — product and model names, so the words
that recur in these scripts are spelled the way we spell them. It is not a request field and you
cannot set it. It can change the words you get back, and changing it invalidates the cache (that is
the "vocabulary" term in the identity above). It biases toward known words; it **cannot** recover a
word the speaker did not say — a script that spells a brand phonetically will transcribe as the
phonetic spelling.

## POST /music

Documented from the live spec `2.7.0` on 2026-08-04, against a deployment with the endpoint enabled.

Renders a music bed from a prompt and returns a `jobId`. **Asynchronous and charged**, exactly like `POST /videos`: poll `GET /generations/{jobId}` to a terminal status. Typical renders finish in about **75 seconds** — much faster than a video.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | **yes** | 1–500 chars. What the track should sound like, as prose: instrumentation, mood, tempo, what it sits under. |
| `style` | no | ≤200 chars. Folded **into** the prompt on our side, not sent as a provider field. |
| `instrumental` | no | Defaults to **`true`**. Leave it — lyrics compete with the voice-over. |
| `durationHintSeconds` | no | 5–180. **Advisory only.** |
| `productId` | no | Files the job under a product. Organizational only. |

The body is strict: an unknown key is a `400`, not a shrug.

**The 500-character ceiling applies to the COMPOSED prompt, not to your field alone.** `style`, the instrumental sentence and the duration hint are all concatenated into one string before submission, and *that* is what is measured — before the charge, so an over-long compose is a free `400` rather than a billed `502`. Leave headroom: a 500-character `prompt` plus any `style` at all is over the line.

**`durationHintSeconds` is a preference, not a setting.** The provider takes no duration parameter in the mode this endpoint uses, so the hint is prose in the prompt. Expect roughly **one to two minutes** of audio whatever you ask for, and trim it yourself. It does not move the price.

**One request returns TWO tracks, for one charge.** The model renders two takes of the same prompt. Both arrive in `audio[]` on the polled job and both are yours; they differ in length and arrangement, not in price. That is why the mixing step can offer named variants without a second render — see the `music-mix` skill.

Response `202`: `jobId`, `status`, `creditsCharged`, `model`. `model` is always **`music-suno`** — fixed, and deliberately absent from `GET /models`, which answers what this API renders *video* with.

**`POST /estimates` has a fourth arm for this, and it takes nothing but the kind:**

```json
{ "kind": "music" }
```

Sending `prompt` alongside it is a `400` (`Unrecognized key: "prompt"`) — the price is **flat per request**, so there is nothing to price on. Verified live 2026-08-04: `credits: 0.5`, and **no `warnings` key**, because there is no visual prompt to advise about.

**Mind the kind asymmetry, it is deliberate:** you *estimate* `kind: "music"` and you *poll* a job whose `kind` is `"audio"`. The estimate names the operation; the job names its output. Neither is a typo to be fixed.

**This endpoint is behind a deployment flag.** Where music is off, `POST /v1/music` answers `400 invalid_input` — not a `404` — and the `music` estimate arm and the `/music` path are absent from `GET /v1/openapi.json`. Check the spec before assuming an outage.

### Failure modes

| Code | Cause |
|---|---|
| `400` | Missing/over-long `prompt`, an over-long **composed** prompt, an unknown key, or music disabled on this deployment. Nothing is charged. |
| `402` | Not enough credits; `details` carries `required` and `available`. |
| `429` | Concurrency ceiling — a music job consumes one of the **5** shared generation slots, the same pool as video. |
| `502` | The provider refused or failed. Terminal, and refunded. |

A prompt the provider's own classifier refuses comes back as terminal status **`blocked`**, not `failed` — rephrase it rather than retrying it, because a retry buys the same refusal.

## GET /generations

| Param | Values |
|---|---|
| `limit` | 1 to 50, default 10 |
| `offset` | default 0 |
| `kind` | `video`, `image`, `audio`, `text` — `audio` is a music job and `text` is a transcript, both spelled for the row's own kind rather than for their estimate arms' `music` / `transcript` |
| `productId` | filter to one product |
| `updatedSince` | ISO 8601. The incremental-sync path: store the highest `updatedAt` you have seen and pass it back. |
| `sortBy` | `createdAt` (default), `updatedAt` |
| `sortOrder` | `desc` (default), `asc` |

Returns `items`, `total`, `limit`, `offset`, `hasMore`. `total` ignores pagination.

This is also the recovery path when a call times out: the work may have run and been charged, and the lost thing is the response carrying the `jobId`.

## GET /generations/{jobId}

`jobId`, `status`, `kind`, `model`, `prompt`, `createdAt`, and once succeeded, `outputUrl` plus `outputUrlExpiresInSeconds` (3600). On failure, `error` carries our own wording, never a provider's raw text, and the credits are already refunded.

**On a `kind: "audio"` job that has succeeded, there is also `audio[]`** — the two tracks a music request delivered, each `{ url, expiresInSeconds, durationSeconds, title }`. `audio[0]` is the canonical one and is what `outputUrl` points at; `audio[1]` is a second take of the same prompt, and **`audio[]` is the only place it is published** — it is not a separate library asset and it will not turn up in a listing. Both URLs are presigned and minted **when you read the job**, so re-poll for fresh ones instead of storing them.

## GET /generations/{jobId}/watch

`302` to a URL signed at request time. `curl -L` friendly, and the right thing to hand a video player or an `<img>` tag, because the signature is minted on request rather than read from something that may have expired in your database.

While the job is unfinished this is a `409` naming the current status.

## GET /products, POST /products

`GET` lists the organization's products. `POST` creates one and returns it with its `id` — that id is what goes in `productId` on every generation call.

**`GET /products` returns the array under `items`, not `products`** (verified live 2026-08-04). This is the same paginated envelope `GET /generations` uses, and the pack previously did not say so anywhere — which left `.products` as the obvious wrong guess:

```json
{ "items": [ { "id": "...", "name": "...", "folders": [], "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." } ],
  "total": 12, "limit": 10, "offset": 0, "hasMore": true }
```

Every list endpoint on this API answers with the same five keys — `items`, `total`, `limit`, `offset`, `hasMore` — so `.items` is the one accessor to learn. `total` ignores pagination. Query params: `limit`, `offset`, `updatedSince`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`.

Each item carries `id`, `name`, `description`, `targetAudience`, `mainFeatures`, `painPoint`, `perceived`, `folders`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. Every descriptive field except `name` can be `null`.

Request body for `POST`, `.strict()` — `name` is the only required field:

| Field | Type | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | **required**, 1 to 200 chars |
| `description` | string | ≤ 2,000 chars |
| `targetAudience` | string | ≤ 500 chars |
| `mainFeatures` | string[] | ≤ 20 items, each ≤ 200 chars |
| `painPoint` | string | ≤ 500 chars |
| `perceived` | string | perceived value — what a buyer feels it is worth. ≤ 500 chars |

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://api.novoads.ai/v1/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOVOADS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Aurora Sleep Tea",
    "description": "A caffeine-free herbal tea blended for people who fall asleep late.",
    "targetAudience": "Adults 25-45 who work late and struggle to wind down.",
    "mainFeatures": ["Caffeine free", "Valerian and chamomile", "Brews in 3 minutes"],
    "painPoint": "Lying awake for an hour after getting into bed.",
    "perceived": "A nightly ritual worth more than the price of a coffee."
  }'
```

**Every descriptive field is stored verbatim and none of them influence what is generated.** Not one reaches the prompt. Filling them in buys you a readable history — `GET /v1/generations?productId=…` becomes a useful filter — and nothing else. Do not treat a product record as a brief the model will read, and do not paste brand voice in here expecting it to change a render; that belongs in `MASTER_CONTEXT.md`, which the agent actually reads.

`PATCH /products/{productId}` takes the same fields, all optional. `GET /products/{productId}/folders` is read-only, and there is no folder-creation endpoint.

## GET /models

The catalog: per model `id`, `displayName`, `kind`, `endpoint`, `credits`, `representativeOutput`, `aspectRatios`, `durationsSeconds`, `maxPromptCharacters`, and — on video models — **`resolutions[]` and `defaultResolution`** (verified live 2026-08-04; the earlier note that this endpoint published no output size is superseded).

**`resolutions[]` is the authority on which tiers a model takes.** Live on 2026-08-04: `seedance-2.0` returns `["480p","720p","1080p","4k"]`; `seedance-2.0-mini`, `omni-flash` and `sora-2` return `["720p"]`; `veo-3.1` returns `["1080p"]`. Read it instead of hardcoding a set — a value outside a model's list is a `400`, not a downscale. Note that only `seedance-2.0` exposes `resolution` as a *request* field: for the fixed-tier models, `resolutions[]` reports what they render, not something you may send.

**`credits` prices `representativeOutput`, and that unit is not the same across models** — one model's representative output is 5 seconds of video, another's is 10. Comparing the two `credits` numbers directly compares different things. For a real comparison, price both at `POST /v1/estimates` with the same `durationSeconds`.

## Status lifecycle

```
queued -> running -> finalizing -> succeeded
                                -> failed
                                -> blocked
                                -> canceled
```

`succeeded`, `failed`, `blocked`, `canceled` are terminal. Nothing else will change.

**Poll for terminal, not for `succeeded`.** A loop waiting only on `succeeded` never exits on a failed job.

`queued` means charged and submitted but not yet rendering. It is normal, not a stall.

Measured on production renders (all providers, succeeded only, p10 to p90):

| model | typical wait | median | observed in this repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seedance-2.0` | 3 to 8 minutes | ~5 minutes | **~171s, ~171s, ~154s** (2026-08-02/03, n=3) |
| `seedance-2.0-mini` | 2 to 3 minutes | ~2.3 minutes | — |
| `omni-flash` | not published | — | — |
| `veo-3.1` | not published | — | — |
| `sora-2` | not published | — | **~123s** (2026-08-02, n=1) |

The right-hand column is `createdAt` → first observed `succeeded` at 15-second poll granularity, so it is an upper bound on a handful of renders — not a distribution, and not a contradiction of the fleet range next to it. **Quote the fleet range where there is one and say the number is a range.** Both renders anyone here has actually timed came back under three minutes, so "about five minutes" is a promise the API did not make: a user told five who waits nine has been misled, and the p90 says nine happens.

For `omni-flash`, `veo-3.1` and `sora-2` there is no published range at all. Say the wait is unknown rather than borrowing Seedance's.

About 4% of `seedance-2.0` renders run past 10 minutes. Failures are usually reported faster than successes, but their tail is much worse, so a wait that is far past p90 is more likely a slow success than a silent failure.

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Requests per key | 60 per minute |
| Requests per organization | 180 per minute, across every key it holds |
| Requests per client address, pre-authentication | 1,200 per minute |
| Concurrent generations per organization | 5 (`429`, `error.code` `rate_limited`, `details.reason` `concurrency_limit`, `Retry-After` 15s) |
| Concurrent **caption** jobs per organization | 10 (`429`, `details.reason` `caption_concurrency_limit`) — a separate budget from the 5 above |
| JSON request body | 64 KB |
| Upload size | 100 MB |
| Upload URL lifetime | 900 seconds |
| Output URL lifetime | 3,600 seconds, minted at read time |
| Live API keys per organization | 10 |

Every response carries `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset`, and a `429` also carries `Retry-After`. Two caveats an agent that paces itself off those headers needs:

- The headers always describe **your per-key budget**. A `429` from the organization ceiling or from the pre-auth ceiling can arrive while they still show room.
- The pre-auth ceiling reports `Retry-After` and **no** `X-RateLimit-*` headers at all.

Concurrency detail worth knowing: the count covers the organization's **API surface only**, so dashboard renders do not consume an integration's slots, and a row stops counting after 30 minutes unfinished, so a stuck job cannot jam an organization permanently. Reads, estimates and uploads are not affected by it.

Cloudflare's edge timeout of roughly 100 seconds is the real ceiling on any single request, which is why video generation is asynchronous and image generation is not (it fits).

---

## Errors

Envelope, on every failure:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "requestId": "...", "details": { } } }
```

**Branch on `code`.** The wording of `message` can change. `requestId` matches the `x-request-id` response header; quoting it makes the whole server-side trace one lookup.

| `code` | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_input` | 400 | **Malformed request only.** `details.issues` names each bad field. Nothing charged. See below. |
| `unauthorized` | 401 | Missing, malformed or revoked key. Carries `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. |
| `insufficient_credits` | 402 | `details` has `required` and `available`, in credits. |
| `forbidden` | 403 | `details.reason` is `plan_required` or `subscription_inactive`, or the API is not enabled for that organization. |
| `not_found` | 404 | No such object **for this organization**. Deliberately indistinguishable from someone else's object. |
| `method_not_allowed` | 405 | Real path, wrong verb. Carries an `Allow` header. |
| `conflict` | 409 | Includes `/watch` on an unfinished job. |
| `content_policy` | 422 | Moderation, and the **only** refusal of a prompt for what it says. Nothing charged. |
| `rate_limited` | 429 | **Four causes.** See below. |
| `internal_error` | 500 | **Do not blindly retry.** See below. |
| `provider_failed` | 502 | Credits refunded automatically. |

### A 400 has one shape

It is a schema rejection, and it names the fields:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "invalid_input", "message": "(root): Unrecognized key: \"styleFamily\"",
  "details": { "issues": [ { "field": "(root)", "message": "Unrecognized key: \"styleFamily\"" } ] } } }
```

An out-of-grid `durationSeconds` and a prompt past the model's ceiling land the same way — the
response names the field and the limit.

**There is no second shape.** Until spec `2.0.0` a prompt-rule failure was also a 400, carrying `details.rule` and `details.violations[]`. Those keys no longer appear on any response — the rules that replaced them are **advisory only** and arrive as the `warnings` array on a `200` from `/estimates`, never as an error. Code that branches on `details.rule` is reading for something that will never arrive; code that wants the craft advice reads `warnings` off the estimate. (The earlier claim here that `warnings` was itself removed in spec `3.0.0` was wrong — deployed spec is `2.6.0` and it returns the field; verified live 2026-08-04.)

### The five causes of a 429

Every one carries `details.reason` and a `Retry-After` header. Those two are the documented
contract: sleep on the header, branch on the reason. `error.details` is a free-form object, so a
response may carry more than the spec names — `details.inFlight` on a concurrency refusal is the
only extra it does name. Do not branch on an undocumented `details` key.

| `details.reason` | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `concurrency_limit` | 5 generations already in flight for the organization; `details.inFlight` says how many | Wait for one to reach a terminal state, then submit. A longer backoff does not help; a finished job does. Generation endpoints only. |
| `caption_concurrency_limit` | **10 caption jobs already in flight** for the organization (verified in spec 2.6.0, 2026-08-04) | Same shape as above: wait, do not slow down. Counted **separately** from `concurrency_limit`, deliberately — a batch of captions can never block your next render, and vice versa. |
| `key_limit` | 60 requests per minute on this key | Honor `Retry-After`. The `X-RateLimit-*` trio tracks this ceiling and only this one. |
| `organization_limit` | 180 requests per minute across every key the organization holds | Honor `Retry-After`. `X-RateLimit-*` will still show room on your key — correct, not a broken limiter. Minting another key does not raise it. |
| `client_limit` | 1,200 requests per minute from one address, **pre-authentication** | Honor `Retry-After`. Carries no `X-RateLimit-*` trio. |

An agent that reads only "429 means slow down" backs off on the wrong axis when the real problem is five jobs in flight.

### The 500 rule

The generation endpoints charge credits, and a failure can land **after** the debit committed. A blind retry can pay twice, and there are no idempotency keys yet.

On a 500: call `GET /v1/generations` first. If the job is there, poll it. Only resubmit if it is genuinely absent.

## Known discrepancies

Dated. Struck through when fixed, never deleted, because a retraction is more useful than a gap.

- ~~**2026-08-01, the published 422 description is wrong.**~~ **Fixed in the spec; re-read 2026-08-02.** The 422 description was corrected once to name 400 as the prompt-rule status, and corrected again when the rules stopped blocking. It now reads: moderation is the ONLY way a prompt is refused for what it says, and a 400 means malformed, "never that we disliked the writing". The underlying behavior never changed: 422 is moderation only.
- ~~**2026-08-01, the per-operation `429` description names only one of its three causes.**~~ **Fixed in the spec, verified 2026-08-02.** Every operation's `429` now names all four ceilings — `key_limit`, `organization_limit`, `concurrency_limit`, `client_limit` — and says how each is paced, including that waiting is the only fix for concurrency. Live probe: a per-key 429 returns `details: {reason: "key_limit", limit: 60, retryAfterSeconds: 51}`.
- ~~**2026-08-01, `styleFamily` on an image estimate has no counterpart on the paid image call.**~~ **Resolved 2026-08-02 by deleting the field.** `styleFamily` is gone from both estimate arms and from every video variant, so the quote and the invoice now accept exactly the same prompt fields. Both arms are strict: sending it is `400 (root): Unrecognized key: "styleFamily"` (verified live on `kind: "video"` and `kind: "image"`). The rules it used to scope no longer refuse anything, so the divergence it caused — price clean, then 400 — is structurally impossible now.

## Prompt rules

**They exist, on `POST /estimates` only, and they are advisory.** The previous text here said there were none and that the `warnings` field had been deleted in spec `3.0.0` (2026-08-03). **That was wrong on both counts: the deployed spec is `2.6.0`, there is no `3.0.0`, and `/estimates` returns `warnings` today** (verified live 2026-08-04).

| | |
|---|---|
| Where | `POST /estimates` **only**. `POST /videos` and `POST /images` do not run them and return no `warnings` field. |
| Shape | `warnings: [{ "rule": string, "message": string }]`. Omitted entirely when nothing fires. |
| Force | **None.** Advisory. They never refuse a call, never change `credits`, and never reach the provider. |
| Scope | Video craft. Rules seen live: `no_spoken_line`, `missing_actor_descriptor`, `label_without_hold`, `chained_motion`. An image estimate with the same trigger words returned **no** `warnings` key; a caption estimate has no prompt and returns none. |

**They match substrings, so they false-positive.** Two reproduced live on 2026-08-04:

- `label_without_hold` fired on the word **"screen"** in a prompt for a SaaS dashboard demo. The rule protects *printed* text on physical packaging; there was no label in the shot, and applying the suggested labelHold clause would have asked the model to preserve a package that does not exist.
- `chained_motion` fired on the word **"Then"** — inside a **quoted spoken line**. The rule looks for a second staged action; this was dialogue. Splitting the shot would have split the actor's sentence.

Neither rule can distinguish a physical package from a UI, or narration from stage direction.

**How to use them:** read every one, judge it against what your prompt actually says and where the matched substring sits, and state your reasoning if you override it. Never paste a suggested fix into a prompt it does not fit, and never drop a warning silently — an unexplained override is indistinguishable from not having read it.

**The skill layer is still the real quality gate.** The prompt libraries carry a practitioner's craft notes and cover everything these four rules do not — which is nearly all of it. Read the formula file for the route before composing; a clean estimate is not a reviewed prompt. Moderation remains the only thing that can *refuse* a prompt for what it says, and it refuses content, not craft — see the `422` row in the error table.

What that leaves the estimate doing is the one thing it was always for: **the price.** It is still mandatory before every render, and it is still the only legitimate source of a number.
