  Analyze a reference video and reverse-engineer its style into a reusable Seedance 2.0

  and tone so it can be recreated with any product, any person, in any setting. Use this
  whenever someone provides a video they want to use as a style reference, says "I want to
  make videos like this", "deconstruct this video", "turn this into a template", "analyze
  this style", or drops a video file and wants to recreate that format repeatedly.

# Analyze video → reusable prompting template

Someone found a video style they love. Your job is to deconstruct it into a reusable
prompting template — a formula they can plug any product, person or setting into and get
that same style back from `seedance-2.0`.

The output is **not** a single prompt. It is a **formula file** saved into
`skills/novoads-api/prompting/prompt-library/`, built the way
[seedance-2-ugc.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2-ugc.md) is built: layers, variables,
option banks, rules, and a worked example, so the agent can generate unlimited prompts in
that style.

**Nothing in steps 1 to 6 touches the API.** Frame extraction, transcription and analysis
are local work on the user's own file: no calls, no credits. Only step 7, the optional test
render, spends anything, and it runs through the two gates in [SKILL.md](../../SKILL.md)
like every other generation.

**The 15-second constraint is the whole design problem.** `seedance-2.0` and
`seedance-2.0-mini` take any integer 4 to 15 seconds, and the reference video is usually
30 to 60. Your template has to distil the style into what fits one 15-second clip, and say
how to recreate the longer arc across a series of clips.

## Dependencies

- **ffmpeg** / **ffprobe** — required for frame and audio extraction (step 1).
  `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS.
- **whisper** — optional, for transcription (step 2). `pip3 install openai-whisper`. If it
  is unavailable, ask the user to paste the dialogue instead.

Neither is a Novoads dependency. Both run locally on the user's file.

## Inputs

- **Video file** (required): path to `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.webm` or similar.
- **Style name** (optional): what to call the template — `car-review`, `unboxing-hype`,
  `skeptic-converted`. If they do not give one, name it from what you observe.

## Step 1: Extract frames and audio

```bash
bash "skills/novoads-api/prompting/analyze-video/scripts/extract-frames.sh" \
  "<video_path>" "/tmp/video-analysis" <num_frames>
```

Frame count by source duration:

| Source duration | Frames |
|---|---|
| Under 10s | 8 |
| 10–20s | 12 |
| 20–30s | 16 |
| Over 30s | 20 |

Read `metadata.txt` for duration, resolution and fps.

## Step 2: Transcribe the audio

Try, in order:

1. `whisper` CLI: `whisper /tmp/video-analysis/audio.wav --model base --output_format txt --output_dir /tmp/video-analysis`
2. Python whisper inline.
3. Neither available → ask the user for the dialogue, or to install whisper.

The transcript is where pacing lives: speech rhythm, filler words, how dialogue interleaves
with action. All of that defines the style, and all of it has to survive into the template.

## Step 3: Study the reference templates

Read the shipped formulas before you write one. They are the standard your output has to
meet:

- [seedance-2-ugc.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2-ugc.md) — 9-layer UGC formula, the richest example
- [seedance-2-premium-reveal.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2-premium-reveal.md) — dark-void reveal, no person
- [seedance-2-product-hero.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2-product-hero.md) — elemental product hero, no person
- [seedance-2-studio-lookbook.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2-studio-lookbook.md) — studio lookbook with voiceover
- [seedance-2-feature-walkthrough.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2-feature-walkthrough.md) — feature demo, multi-clip series

And the platform guide, which every one of them defers to:

- [seedance-2.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2.md) — request fields, the grid, prompt craft, what the estimate flags, the adaptation checklist

Notice what they share:

- They name **layers** — the structural building blocks of the style.
- Each layer has a **pattern**: a repeatable sentence shape with `{{VARIABLES}}`.
- Variables come with **option banks**, not blanks.
- They state **rules** that explain why a choice matters.
- They declare a **mode** — `startImageAssetId` or `referenceAssetIds` — at the top.
- They carry a **worked example** that has been priced live, with its warning set recorded.

Your template has to hit that depth to be usable.

## Step 4: Analyze the frames — find what defines this style

Read **all** the extracted frames. You are not describing one video; you are isolating the
transferable pattern.

For every dimension ask: "is this specific to THIS VIDEO — the person, the product, the
room — or is it THE STYLE?" Only the style goes into the template. The specifics become
variables.

### Structure and pacing

- How long is the source? How many distinct beats?
- Which 2–3 beats are essential — the ones without which it stops being this style?
- What is the arc? Hook → demo → proof → verdict, or something else?
- Fast cuts or held shots? How long is each beat?
- Silent beats, or wall-to-wall dialogue?
- **The compression question:** if you had to carry the whole feel in 3 beats and 2–3
  spoken lines, which moments survive?

### Camera and framing

- Filming perspective: selfie, propped phone, second operator, screen recording?
- How does framing change between beats — tighter, wider, same angle throughout?
- Is there a signature move that *is* the style?

### Edit style

- Jump cuts, continuous take, time-lapse, split screen?
- Transitions: hard cuts, dissolves, text?
- Recurring motifs: close-up product inserts, reaction face, before/after?

### Dialogue and script structure

- Hook format: question, bold claim, mid-action, reaction?
- Scripted, improvised, voiceover, text-on-screen?
- Speech patterns that carry the tone: filler words, sentence length, vocabulary.
- How lines relate to what the hands are doing.

### Tone and energy

- 3–4 emotion words for the vibe.
- Energy arc: builds, flat, peaks then drops?
- Relationship to the viewer: friend, expert, skeptic, fan?

### Lighting and technical quality

- Light source and direction: natural, ring light, moody, blown out?
- Phone or polished? Which technical "flaws" are load-bearing?
- Audio character: phone mic, lapel, voiceover, room tone?

### What makes this style DIFFERENT

The most important pass. After cataloguing everything above, name the 2–3 things that
separate this from a generic UGC clip or a generic product review — the pacing, the hook
format, the way the product enters frame, the edit rhythm. Those become the core of the
template; everything else is scaffolding.

### The 15-second plan

Before building anything, map the style onto one clip:

- **What is the minimum viable version?** Which beats are essential, which are nice to
  have. Fifteen seconds has to carry the thing that makes someone say "oh, *that* kind of
  video".
- **Does it need a series?** If the power is in a narrative arc or a feature rundown, it
  needs 2–3 clips. If it is a vibe or a single moment, one clip is enough.
- **How many spoken lines fit?** A dense product line runs 2.5 to 3 words per second, a
  calmer lifestyle line closer to 1.5. Fifteen seconds is 2–3 short sentences, and the
  slack is what leaves room for a silent beat. Count the source's lines and keep the ones
  carrying the voice.
- **What is the beat skeleton?** 15 seconds is 2–3 beats: hook → core moment → kicker.

### Which mode the style wants

Every formula in this library declares one, because they are mutually exclusive on the API
and the choice follows from the style:

| If the style… | Mode | Why |
|---|---|---|
| opens on the product itself, held up or sitting on a surface | `startImageAssetId` | the product photo is literally the first frame |
| builds a scene the product was never photographed in — a void, a splash, a studio set | `referenceAssetIds` | the model has to composite it, not animate a flat photo |
| holds one person across a series of clips | `referenceAssetIds` | `@Image1` the product, `@Image2` the person — Seedance re-casts on every cut, and a repeated description does not hold a face |

Write the answer into the template. A formula that leaves the mode open produces prompts
whose `@Image1` tokens point at nothing.

## Step 5: Build the template

Create a self-contained markdown file. Someone should be able to read it and write prompts
in this style without ever seeing the source video.

### Template structure

```markdown
# [Style name] — Seedance 2.0

**Use when:** [the kind of video this produces]

**Model guide:** read [seedance-2.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2.md) first for the request fields, the grid,
and the platform rules.

**Mode:** `startImageAssetId` or `referenceAssetIds` — say which, and what each `@ImageN`
slot holds. The two are separate modes and a body carrying both is a `400`.

## What defines this style

[2–3 paragraphs of theory. This is what lets a prompt writer make good variable choices
instead of filling blanks.]

## Things to know before you write a word

[The route-specific traps. If the style speaks, say that the line is rendered and
lip-synced in this same call and that gate 1 applies. If it is silent, say that silence has
to be declared in the prose.]
mandatory.]

## The structure

[The layers of THIS style. Do not force-fit the 9-layer UGC model. Five layers, twelve
layers — let the video decide.]

## Layer-by-layer formula

### Layer N: [Name]

[What this layer does and why it matters here.]

**Pattern:**
\```
[The repeatable sentence shape with {{VARIABLES}}]
\```

| Variable | Options | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VARIABLE_NAME` | option 1, option 2, option 3 | [guidance] |

### [... more layers ...]

## Beat structure (one 15-second clip)

[The 3-beat framework: hook, core, kicker. Which beats speak and which are silent. Two to
three spoken lines total.]

## Multi-clip strategy (if applicable)

[How to split across 2–3 clips, what each one covers, and what holds identity across them:
the same `referenceAssetIds` in every call plus the actor tag repeated verbatim.]

## Tone and pacing guide

[Energy, speech patterns, rhythm, with a pacing-cue bank specific to this style.]

## Technical specs

[Lighting, camera quality, audio character — including the flaws that make it authentic.]

## Complete template

[One copy-paste block for ONE 15-second clip, every variable marked {{PLACEHOLDER}}.
Max 3 beats, max 2–3 spoken lines. This is the unit.]

## Example prompt

[The template filled in for a DIFFERENT product, person and setting than the source video.
Price it at POST /v1/estimates before shipping it and record its warning set underneath.]

## Adaptation checklist

[The style-specific checks, then the standard ones from seedance-2.md.]

## Generating from this template

[The call sequence — see step 7 of analyze-video for the block to paste here.]
```

### Rules the template has to teach

These are not style preferences. Each one is a defect found in a shipped formula, and a
template that omits them manufactures the same defect in every prompt written from it.

- **Every prompt is one clip of 4 to 15 seconds.** If the style needs more, the template
  ships a multi-clip strategy — never a longer prompt.

- **Keep prompts between 100 and 260 words.** Shorter prompts produce vague results; longer
  ones overwhelm the model and cause it to lose focus on key details. Do not pad to hit the
  floor and do not cut a beat's framing to stay under the ceiling.

- **Variables are curated choices, not blanks.** "Any lighting" is useless. "Natural window
  light, overhead kitchen light, golden-hour balcony light" is a decision the writer can
  actually make.

- **Declare the mode and address references as `@Image1`, `@Image2`, …** The tokens resolve
  **positionally** against `referenceAssetIds` in the order the array is sent, and a token
  pointing past the end of the array is refused before the charge. If the style uses a
  start frame instead, say so and use no tokens at all.


- **If the style is silent, say so in prose** — `a silent product film with no spoken
  dialogue`, `silent b-roll`. Seedance renders audio from the prompt, so a film that never
  declares silence can come back with an invented voice on it. On-screen-text strings in
  quotes are enough to satisfy the linter and not enough to make the render silent.

- **No polish words.** The list the estimate actually flags: `cinematic`, `flawless`,
  `perfect`, `8k`, `4k`, `hyper-detailed`, `beauty lighting`, `ultra-realistic`,
  `masterpiece`, `award-winning`, and their Spanish and Portuguese equivalents. `studio` and
  `professional` are **not** on it — judge those by route, not by list. Replace a polish
  word with the real thing: the light source, the surface, the flaw.

- **Prose, never a bulleted prompt.** A run of `Label: value` pairs or `-` lines comes back
  **rendered as literal text on screen**. Use timestamps — `[00:00]`, `[00:05]` — for
  multi-beat pacing instead.

- **One primary action per shot**, with two or three comma-joined cues on it. A second
  action chained with `then` / `and then` / `followed by` renders as a smear. Split it into
  two shots.

- **Repeat the actor tag verbatim.** `the same woman` resolves to nobody; identity does not
  carry across a cut.

- **The example must use different content than the source.** If the source was a woman
  reviewing a serum in her bedroom, the example is a guy reviewing a protein bar in his
  kitchen. That is what proves the template generalises.

- **Dialogue has to fit.** Count the words: about 2.5 to 3 per second for a dense product
  line, 1.5 for a calm one. If the source talks fast, say so in the template and keep each
  line punchy.

- **No credit numbers anywhere in the template.** Prices come from a live
  `POST /v1/estimates` in the session that spends them. A template that quotes a number
  teaches the next agent to skip the call.

## Step 6: Save, register and present

1. Save to `skills/novoads-api/prompting/prompt-library/seedance-2-<style-name>.md`.
2. **Add a row to the style directory** in
   [seedance-2.md](../prompt-library/seedance-2.md) so the new formula is reachable —
   user goal, file link, key trait, matching the rows already there. A formula nothing
   points at is a formula nobody reads.
3. Summarise in chat: the style you identified, its layers, what makes it distinct, and the
   path you saved it to.
4. Ask: *"Want me to price a test prompt from this template and render it, to prove it
   works?"*

If they say yes, write the prompt for a different product, person and setting than the
source — that is the actual test — and run step 7.

## Step 7: Render a test clip (optional, and it costs credits)

The template is the deliverable; this step only proves it. It runs the full sequence from
[SKILL.md](../../SKILL.md), and **both gates apply**.

1. **Upload the product photo** if the prompt references one:

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST https://api.novoads.ai/v1/uploads \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOVOADS_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"contentType":"image/jpeg","sizeBytes":248193}'
   ```

   then PUT the raw bytes to the `uploadUrl` it returns, sending back **exactly** the
   headers it returned. The `assetId` is durable and reusable across calls, models and
   sessions — upload once and keep the id.

2. **Price it — gate 2.** `POST /v1/estimates` with `kind: "video"`, the `prompt`, the
   `model` and `durationSeconds`. It is free, it is the only source of a price, and it is
   the only place the prompt rules run at all. Read the `warnings` out before spending;
   every one of them is advisory, and `POST /v1/videos` runs none of them.

3. **Confirm the spoken line — gate 1**, if the clip speaks. Numbered beats, word count
   against the duration, the `language` you are sending, an explicit yes. Approving the
   template is not approving the sentence.

4. **Generate:**

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST https://api.novoads.ai/v1/videos \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOVOADS_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "seedance-2.0",
       "prompt": "<the filled-in prompt>",
       "durationSeconds": 15,
       "aspectRatio": "9:16",
       "language": "en",
       "referenceAssetIds": ["<assetId>"],
       "productId": "<uuid>"
     }'
   ```

   Swap `referenceAssetIds` for `startImageAssetId` if that is the template's mode. Never
   both. Returns `202` with `jobId` and `creditsCharged`.

5. **Poll** `GET /v1/generations/{jobId}` every 15 seconds until a **terminal** status —
   `succeeded`, `failed`, `blocked` or `canceled`. Not until `succeeded`: a loop waiting
   for success never returns on a job that died. `seedance-2.0` usually takes 3 to 8
   minutes, most often around 5; `seedance-2.0-mini` 2 to 3.

6. **Download** `GET /v1/generations/{jobId}/watch`, save under
   `outputs/<descriptive-subfolder>/`, and open the folder so the user can watch it.

**Draft on `seedance-2.0-mini` first.** It is the same grid, the same fields and the same
prompt at half the price, back in 2 to 3 minutes — and since the `assetId` is durable, the
final render on `seedance-2.0` reuses the same upload. A template validated on mini is a
template validated.

Paste this block into every template you generate, so the formula carries its own call
sequence:

```markdown
## Generating from this template

1. Upload the product photo: `POST /v1/uploads` → `assetId` (durable, reuse it).
2. Price it: `POST /v1/estimates` with `kind: "video"`, `model`, `durationSeconds`,
   `prompt`. Free, mandatory, and the only place the prompt rules run — read the
   `warnings` out loud before spending.
3. Confirm the spoken line with the user if the clip speaks (`SKILL.md` gate 1).
4. Generate: `POST /v1/videos`

\```json
{
  "model": "seedance-2.0",
  "prompt": "<your filled-in prompt>",
  "durationSeconds": 15,
  "aspectRatio": "9:16",
  "language": "en",
  "referenceAssetIds": ["<assetId>"]
}
\```

   `startImageAssetId` instead if that is this formula's mode — never both, that is a `400`.

5. Poll `GET /v1/generations/{jobId}` every 15s until a terminal status, then download from
   `GET /v1/generations/{jobId}/watch`.

Every clip in a series is its own call and its own charge. Five generations per
organization may be in flight at once.
```
