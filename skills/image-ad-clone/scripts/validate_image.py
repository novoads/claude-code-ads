"""
Round-trip a clone-workflow prompt through any Novoads image model.

This is the image-ad-clone skill's validator, NOT a production generator. The two
generator skills are deliberately model-locked (chatgpt-image-ad to gpt-image-2,
nano-banana-image-ad to nano-banana-pro) so a production run cannot drift models by
accident. Cloning has the opposite requirement: Phase 4 validates against one model
and Phase 8 re-runs the SAME template on another to fill in the Model notes block.
So this one takes --model, applies that model's own grid, and refuses nothing.

`reve-2.1` is reachable only from here — it has no generator skill of its own.

It also carries the clone workflow's EDIT path: --source-image / --source-asset-id
send `sourceAssetId` (gpt-image-2 only), which repaints named zones of an existing
image while leaving the rest of the frame alone. That is Phase 7's second instrument
— see the guide. It is mutually exclusive with --aspect-ratio, because an edit's
output tracks the source's shape.

Novoads generates images synchronously — the POST blocks for the render (typically
60-90 seconds) and returns the finished images. There is nothing to poll.

Output contract:
  stdout: one JSON object per generated image, one per line
          {"variant": int, "path": str, "job_id": str,
           "width": int, "height": int, "prompt": str,
           "aspect_ratio": str, "model": str, "credits_charged": float}
  stderr: human-readable progress + errors
  exit:   0 on success; 1 if the generation failed; 2 on bad args.

Stdlib only. No requests, no python-dotenv.
