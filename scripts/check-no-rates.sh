# Ratchet: a skill file may describe the METER. It may not state the RATE.
#
# The failure this exists for, which has now happened in both repos: someone
# writes "0.4 credits per billed minute" into a skill file because it was true
# the day they measured it. The agent reads that file at spend time, quotes the
# number to the user, and takes the money. When the price moves, nothing goes
# red — the file still parses, every test still passes, every link still
# resolves — and the skill keeps quoting a figure that stopped being true. The
# user is told one price and charged another, by a document that was correct
# when it was written.
#
# It is not fixed by "keeping the numbers up to date". Nothing can tell you a
# rate rotted; that is the whole problem. It is fixed by never writing the rate
# down: every one of these endpoints has a free `POST /v1/estimates` arm whose
# entire job is to answer this question at the moment it is asked. Quote the
# tool at spend, not the file.
#
# A rate kept "as rationale" still gets quoted, so this catches those too. What
# it deliberately does NOT catch is the meter's SHAPE — "per minute of source,
# rounded up, one-minute minimum", "flat per call, whatever comes back", "the
# stills are a fraction of the clips". That is durable behaviour and ordering,
# it is what a reader actually needs, and it is exactly what should survive the
# rewrite when this guard fires.
#
# Fenced code blocks are skipped, the same precedent check-links.sh sets. A
# A fenced json block showing what `POST /v1/estimates` RETURNS is documentation of
# response shape, not a price list — and its numbers are illustrative by
# construction, because the endpoint's whole purpose is to replace them.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check-no-rates.sh   (exit 0 clean, 1 on any un-allowlisted hit)

# Each entry: <path-regex>::<extended-regex the line must match>
#
# LINE patterns, never `<path>::.*`. A whole-file exemption shipped twice in this
# repo's guards and was proved to be a hole both times; the anchors below are

#
# Two sections, and the difference is load-bearing.

  # ── §A. Not a rate at all ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # The unit DEFINITION. It exists to stop an agent reporting a charge in the
  # wrong unit, and its instruction is literally "echo the number as given" —
  # the opposite of quoting a figure from a file. Nothing here rots: the
  # credit/centi-credit ratio is the API's own arithmetic, not a price.

  # ── §B. Recorded debt ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Real rate literals that this PR did not fix, because they live outside its
  # file set. Recorded rather than ignored, on the same forward-only principle
  # as scripts/skill-size-baseline.txt: today's debt is written down, tomorrow's
  # is refused. This section only ever SHRINKS. Do not add to it to make a red
  # run green — fix the line, or the guard buys nothing.

# ── Scan ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Scoped to skill markdown — the files an agent reads mid-run, which is where a
# quoted rate does its damage. README.md, AGENTS.md and CHANGELOG.md were checked
# against these same patterns while this was written and carry no rate literals;
# widening the glob below is a one-line change if that stops being true.
#
# The scanner is read into a variable FIRST and piped to python3 second, rather
# than living inside HITS="$(python3 - <<PY ...)". A quoted heredoc nested inside
# a command substitution is not reliably literal: bash keeps scanning it for the
# closing paren, and a lone apostrophe or backtick in a Python comment reads as
# an unterminated quote, which fails as "unexpected EOF" pointing at a line with
# nothing wrong on it. Hoisting the heredoc to the top level removes the trap
# instead of tiptoeing around it.
