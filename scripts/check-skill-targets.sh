# Ratchet: a sentence that ROUTES to a skill must name a skill that is here.
#
# The failure, from #87: two descriptions deflected users to skills this pack
# does not ship — "that's `pixar-style-ad`", "that's `adtable-light`" — and one
# more sent them to "a hook skill" that has never existed. A dangling route is
# worse than no route at all. The agent reads it, reports the named skill
# unavailable, and the user is left holding a name they cannot act on and no idea
# what to do instead. Nothing errors, and the description that did it was the
# most-read line in the file.
#
# check-links.sh cannot catch this: these are BARE NAMES in prose, not markdown
# links, so there is no path for it to resolve. That is the whole gap.
#
# ── How it decides something is a route, which is the hard part ───────────────
#
# This pack's vocabulary is ad-shaped, so hyphenated tokens ending in "-ad" are
# everywhere and almost none of them are skill names: `image-ad` appears 85 times
# as an ordinary noun, `novoads-env` is a dotfile, `competitor-ads` is an
# endpoint, `rank-ads` is a script. A grep for name-shaped tokens alone returns
# 250 hits and is unusable — it would be ignored within a week.
#
# Every hit needs a ROUTING phrase — "use X", "that's X", "switch to X", "hand
# off to X", "route to X", "offer X", "invoke X", "see X", "is X", or "X skill".
# On top of that, one of two things must be true of the token:
#
#   A. it is in `backticks`, and hyphenated. A name written as a code span inside
#      a routing sentence is a route whatever it is called — this is the rule
#      that catches an arbitrary name like `adtable-light`, which no shape rule
#      could predict, because it shares nothing with our vocabulary.
#
#   B. it is bare (no backticks) and shaped like one of this pack's skill names:
#      starts with novoads- / clone- / spy-, or ends in -ad / -ads. Bare names do
#      get written ("a STATIC IMAGE ad is clone-image-ad"), but bare prose is
#      where the false positives live, so the shape requirement earns its keep
#      here and only here.
#
# Measured on this corpus: rule B's shape test over ALL bare tokens returns 250
# candidates and would be ignored within a week; adding the routing cue takes it
# to zero. Rule A returns three, all model IDs, which is what KNOWN_NON_SKILLS
# below is for. Together they catch every shape #87 fixed and leave prose its
# nouns.
#
# Tokens with a capital letter are skipped: a directory name is lowercase, so
# "## Image-ad skill ecosystem" is a heading about a topic, not a route to a
# skill named Image-ad.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check-skill-targets.sh   (exit 0 clean, 1 on any dangling route)

# EMPTY, and measured rather than assumed: every routing phrase in the pack
# currently names a skill that exists. Wave 1 (#87) closed the last three.
#
# Add an entry only for a route that legitimately names something outside this
# tree — the likely case is an attribution citing another repository's layout,
# the way references/NOTICE.md cites `shared/skills/pixar-style-ad/prompting/` in
# krusemediallc/arcads-claude-code. Those are paths in someone else's repo, not
# routes into ours, and they read as dangling to a lexical check. They do not
# trip this guard today because a citation is not a routing phrase; if one ever
# is, exempt the LINE, never the file.
