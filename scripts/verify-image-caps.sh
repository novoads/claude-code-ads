# Claims audit for the per-model image caps: referenceAssetIds AND prompt characters.
#
# This repo states API limits in scripts and docs; the API moves without asking us.
# Both caps have drifted already. Spec 2.7.0 raised nano-banana-pro's references from
# 4 to 14 and the pack said 4 for two days. Spec 2.16.0 then split the prompt ceiling,
# which had been a single 4,000 on every model, into three different numbers, and the
# pack enforced 4,000 locally for a day: generators died pre-network on prompts the
# API would have taken whole. So this script is the standing alarm for both:
#
#   1. Fetches the LIVE openapi.json (public, no key) and extracts each image
#      model's referenceAssetIds maxItems and prompt maxLength — matched by the
#      schema's `model` enum value, never by schema name, so a schema rename cannot
#      mis-map a cap.
#   2. Asserts the three generator/validator scripts ENFORCE those caps, by
#      running them: cap+1 refs must be refused naming the cap; cap refs must
#      pass the gate (and then die at a nonexistent --env-file, BEFORE any
#      network call — nothing here needs a key and nothing can spend). The prompt
#      ceiling gets the same treatment, measured at the exact boundary: a body one
#      character past what the always-on suffixes leave must be refused naming the
#      cap, and a body exactly at it must pass.
#   3. Greps the docs for resurrected universal-cap claims, of either kind.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)  full audit, hard exit 1 on any mismatch — run before shipping cap
#              or doc changes, paste the output into the PR.
#   --soft     spec-vs-expected only, WARN and always exit 0 — wired into
#              check-novoads-env.sh so every skill preflight surfaces drift
#              without ever blocking an offline machine.
#
# No jq, no API key, no spend. python3 stdlib only.
