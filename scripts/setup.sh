# First-run setup for the Novoads skill pack.
# Creates .env, MASTER_CONTEXT.md, syncs skills, and verifies API connectivity.
#
# The credential is validated against a live endpoint BEFORE it is written to
# disk. A .env holding a key that has never been probed is the most expensive
# state to debug, because every later failure looks like a different bug.
#
# TWO MODES, because an agent is a first-class user of this script:
#
#   interactive      (a TTY on stdin) prompts for the key, hidden, up to 3 times.
#   non-interactive  (--non-interactive, or stdin is not a TTY) prompts for
#                    NOTHING. It creates the files, syncs the skills, reports
#                    the exact remaining human step, and exits 0.
#
# The second mode is not a convenience. An agent driving this repo cannot type
# into a hidden `read -rs`, so without it the agent either hangs or reimplements
# the script by hand, and the setup that ships is not the setup anyone runs.

#
# The opening itself belongs to shared/scripts/open-env.sh, which owns the
# platform rules — GUI editors only, because $EDITOR on this path is vim with no
# terminal attached, which hangs or dies and either way the run stops being
# about the key; skipped over SSH, in CI, with no display server, and under
# NOVOADS_SETUP_NO_OPEN=1. Its contract is three exit codes: 0 the file is
# genuinely on screen, 3 deliberately skipped, 2 called wrong (the only one that
# prints anything, to stderr). This caller always passes exactly one argument, so
# only 0 and 3 are reachable from here, and the helper is silent on both — the
# caller prints its own sentence. So this function decides one thing, which
# sentence the closing message uses, and it can never fail the run.
#
# The helper may be ABSENT. Skills here install standalone, and someone may run
# this script from a partial tree, so a missing shared/ is an ordinary state
# rather than a broken one: skip silently, leave ENV_OPENED at 0, and let the
# closing message fall back to "paste it into .env".
#
# Written with `if` rather than `[[ ... ]] && return`: under `set -e` a bare

# The same close, addressed to the AI agent driving setup — printed INSTEAD of

# reasons it lives here and not only in AGENTS.md:
#
#   1. The advertised flow starts in an EMPTY directory ("<repo url> help me
#      set this up"), so no agent-instruction file is loaded when that session
#      begins, and nothing guarantees one is read after the clone. This
#      script's stdout is the one channel that flow always reads — which is
#      how a session at a commit that already carried the AGENTS.md template
#      (#41/#42) still closed with an engineering log, a two-option key menu,
#      and an MCP digression (2026-08-08).
#
#   2. An agent shown two phrasings of the same remaining step relays both as
#      a menu. One block, one phrasing, stated as the whole message.
#
# What this block is NOT: a gag. An earlier version told the agent the close was
# its "ENTIRE closing message, verbatim" and that a connected connector "must not
# be mentioned". Both backfired on 2026-08-08: a setup session read those lines,
# correctly recognised an instruction to withhold information from the user, and
# disclosed the attempt as a warning — so the connector got a paragraph instead
# of the silence the wording was reaching for. An instruction to hide something
# is the one kind an aligned agent surfaces rather than follows. State the
# preference and the reason, say plainly that nothing here is secret, and the
# same agent relays the close without editorialising.
