# The doctor — every guard in this repo, run once, scored on one surface.
#
# WHAT IT IS. Orchestration and presentation, nothing else. Every dimension
# below shells out to a script that already exists and already runs in CI; the
# doctor adds no check of its own and reimplements none of them. If the doctor
# and a guard ever disagree, the guard is right — that is the whole point of it
# owning no logic.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. `.github/workflows/guard.yml` runs sixteen checks across eight
# jobs, and a contributor's only local equivalent is the hand-maintained list in
# CONTRIBUTING.md — which is deliberately hand-maintained, and therefore
# deliberately incomplete: it has never listed the collisions, targets, toc,
# evals-present, routing-evals or generated checks. So the honest answer to "is
# this repo shippable right now" took eleven commands and a careful reading of
# eleven separate outputs, and the checks nobody remembered to list were the ones
# nobody ran. One command, one table, one verdict.
#
# It is NOT a CI job and must not become one. CI already runs each piece, in its
# own job, so a failure there names its own remedy on the check that failed. A
# doctor job would report one red X for sixteen possible causes, which is exactly
# the "sharing a red X would report the wrong fix" that guard.yml's comments
# refuse for the checks it keeps separate. This surface is for a human or an
# agent standing in the repo asking one question.
#
# ── CORE vs BADGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# CORE (10). A failure means the repo is blocked: CI is red, or will be. These
# are the checks whose subject is CORRECTNESS — a claim that is false, a link
# that resolves nowhere, a description that truncates, a generated file that no
# longer matches its source.
#
# BADGE (5). A measurement, not a verdict. Their subject is DEBT: a table of
# contents nobody has written yet, a description that is correct and shipping but
# close to the cap, a skill over the 500-line spine and recorded in the baseline.
# None of that is wrong today, so none of it blocks. A badge is EARNED at zero
# debt and otherwise reports the number, because a badge that could be earned by
# picking a friendlier threshold measures the threshold instead of the repo.
#
# The one place badges DO block: if a badge's underlying script EXITS NONZERO,
# that is a real failure of a check CI also runs — a stale TOC entry, a broken
# unit suite — and the doctor exits nonzero for it. Un-earned is not failure;
# errored is. A doctor that exits 0 while CI is red would be worse than no
# doctor, and this is the seam where that could happen quietly.
#
