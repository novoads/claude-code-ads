#
# That skill is a PORT. Its craft arrived whole from a vendor-connector skill of
# the same shape and only the transport was rewritten, so it has two failure
# modes that pull in opposite directions and a reviewer reliably only looks for
# one of them:
#
#   drift       a craft section quietly thinned in the move. The port is worth
#               nothing if the part worth porting did not arrive.
#
#   half-port   a retired tool name or a retired API claim left in place. Worse
#               than drift, because it does not read as wrong: the agent follows
#               it and either stalls on a tool that does not exist or spends a
#               render on a 400 this repo already knows about.
#
# So this checks BOTH directions. The judgement half — has the craft been
# softened rather than deleted — is in the skill's evals.md and cannot be
# grepped. This file owns only what a string match can settle, which is the half
# that should never have needed a human.
#
# Costs nothing and touches no network. Usage: ./scripts/test-parity-i2m.sh

# ── 1. Half-port: retired names and retired claims ───────────────────────────
# Each pattern is a thing the SOURCE skill said that is false or unreachable on
# /v1. `nbGenerations` and a 1080p ask are both live-verified 400s (2026-08-10);
# the other three name a vendor tool or a vendor behaviour we do not have.
#
# SCOPE is the table's first column. Tool NAMES are banned in every file of the
# skill (`all`) -- nothing in this pack can call one, wherever it is written, and a
# reference file added later inherits the ban instead of escaping it. Retired
# CLAIMS about API behaviour are scoped to SKILL.md (`skill`), because that is the
# file an agent follows at runtime while evals.md has to quote the old wording
# plainly to say what it tests.
#
# That split replaced a whole-file exemption for evals.md, which a review proved
# was a hole: the retired names could be appended there and the guard stayed green
# at 23/23. Same self-exemption failure that shipped in check-no-gag.sh once
# already. But removing it outright left evals.md green only because it happened to
# punctuate around the literals, which makes the real coverage "strings nobody
# repunctuated". Hence scope-with-a-reason rather than exemption-by-convenience.
